# Setup

-   Python version doesn't really matter, we use 3.11
-   Please use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (sort of setup in main.py) and the [OpenAI library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)

# Running the development server

make sure you have a .env file with the OPENAI_API_KEY

```
fastapi dev main.py
make sure dev server is running on port 8000
```

# Running the frontend

```
npm run dev
make sure dev server is running on port 5173
```
